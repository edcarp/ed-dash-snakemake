# ed-dash-snakemake
Work in progress for Snakemake course

The actual course, formatted for carpentries, will go into the carpentries incubator...

Now done:
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/snakemake-novice-bioinformatics

This repo is for sharing test stuff with the workflows group.

Does anyone know how to make this repo appear under https://github.com/orgs/edcarp/teams/ed-dash/repositories??
