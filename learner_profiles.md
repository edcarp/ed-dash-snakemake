## Learner profiles

Here are some profiles or people I'd expect to see on the course. They are completely invented by me, but based on
experience of who has been on previous courses. Nathan will contact form previous course attendees to see if we can get
some real profiles.

Failing that, we can slap some silly names on these and they shoudl do.

## Profile 1 - "X"

X just completed a PhD in microbiology and has taken up a postdoc role in a new lab. During her PhD she mostly
worked in the wet lab but also performed the data analysis for her project. Initially she tried to do this with Excel
but after attending an introductory Python course she continued self-learning and wrote some analysis scripts that ran
nicely on the department Linux server. Her new head-of-lab sees that X has an aptitude for programming and has
asked her to adopt and extend some pipeline code that the lab uses to process their mouse fecal metabarcoding results.

At present the code only runs on one old Mac in the corner of the lab and is hard to configure as several input
parameters must be copied from a spreadsheet and then three steps need to be started manually over the course of several
hours. The codes consists of a mixture of BASH scripts and Python written by a previous member of the team who has now
left. X is enthusiastic but after two months wrestling with the codebase it just seems to be getting messier, and
the last time she tried to change something significant the code crashed part way through processing and had to be
reverted. She has adopted the approach of leaving the old code untouched wherever possible and writing new Python
wrappers to add functionality. X fears she is out of her depth working with this codebase, but she really wants to
impress her new team and properly get to grips with the system.

The Snakemake Pipelines course will show X how a data processing pipeline can be designed and constructed around
Snakemake workflows. It will teach how to configure those workflows in a logical way, making them robust and portable.
It will demonstrate how her existing Python knowledge can be applied in these new workflows. Ultimately, X should
have the confidence to replace old problematic code with redesigned modules, and be able to articulate to her team the
benefits of this approach.

X will also benefit from other modules in the carpentries, specifically around version control and code testing.

## Profile 2 - "Y"

Y has worked for 12 years in the genotyping lab at Prestonfield University. Her manager is encouraging her to
develop new skills in data analysis in order for Y to progress her career and help the lab adapt to work with more
data-intensive techniques like RAD-seq. Y has recently been on an introductory Linux course. She enjoyed this and
was able to work through the course material and complete most of the exercises, but felt herself to be slow and
struggling compared to others on the course, who seemed to be more computer-savvy.

Y is still rather wary of putting her newfound Linux skills into practise. She mostly sticks to running the standard
commands which are part of the established process within the facility. She does not yet see herself as a prospective
bioinformatician or programmer but does recognise that there is an opportunity to be grasped and is a willing learner.

The Snakemake course will reinforce and build on the Linux knowledge that Y gained from the earlier course. While
the example data used in the course in not exactly the type that she works with, the general approach should translate
to ideas that can be applied in the genotyping lab. After installing Snakemake onto the facility server, Y will
gain the confidence to propose these new ideas to her manager and to start trying them out.

## Profile 3 - "Z"

Z is a PI of a small research group that studies pesticide resistance in weevils. The group sends RNA samples
for Illumina sequencing and receives back raw results. Z has decent experience with the tools used for data
analysis, having worked hands-on with the first 5 datasets that were sequenced, and is known as a bit of an "R wizard".

Following the release of a new weevil genome, Z is looking at the feasibility of re-analysing his previous datasets
against the new genome build. A colleague suggested that Snakemake might help, and being a hands-on person he has
decided to attend the course himself, along with a postdoc from his lab. He's also considering that the reanalysis task
could form the basis of a project for a bioinformatics masters student, to be supervised by the postdoc. Either way, he
would like to understand how it all works, even if the life of a PI doesn't give much time ofr hands-on coding.
